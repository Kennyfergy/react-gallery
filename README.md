# React Gallery

## Description

This project is a gallery that has pictures and each picture can be clicked to read a description. Additionally there is a like button that when clicked, updates the number of likes for the photo.

A few challenges ran into during this project include: managing props, changing the number of likes on the page, and organizing the code so each gallery item is added to the gallery list.

In this project I used 3 components:

App - represents the overall application or site
GalleryList - represents the gallery of images
GalleryItem - represents a single image in the gallery with the ability to click the image to toggle between image and description as well as the ability to like an image

## Installation

1. Clone Repository
2. Run 'npm install'
3. Run 'npm run server'
4. Run 'npm run client' - you will need multiple terminals open for this
5. App should open in your browser
